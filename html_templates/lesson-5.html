		<b> Summary: </b>
			Recursion is the process of defining, or solving a problem, in terms of a simpler version of itself. It is a powerful tool used to design and write algorithms to solve problems.
			<br> 
			<br>
			Recursive algorithms consist of 2 separate components: 
			<ol>
				<li> Base Case </li>
				<li> Recursive Case </li>
			</ol>
			Fibonacci Sequence Example: Recursion comes directly from the field of mathematics. One problem that is a recursive problem is the Fibonacci Sequence. The Fibonacci Sequence is the sequence of numbers where the first two numbers are 0 and 1 respectively, and all numbers thereafter are defined as the sum of the prior two numbers. 
			<br>
			0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
			<br>
			<br>
			In this sequence, the first two numbers, 0 and 1, are the <b>Base Case</b>. The operation of adding these two numbers together to get the number 1 as the third number is the action of the <b>Recursive Case</b>. This process repeats infinitely to produce the Fibonacci Sequence.

		<br>
		<b> Summary: </b>
		MapReduce is a programming model and implementation for to process and generating large datasets in parallel. It breaks files into chunks, and then processes these chunks in parallel. This is done by defining a <i> map </i> function to process a key/value pair in order to create a set of intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. A <i> reduce </i> function is also made that aggregates all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key.
		<br>
		<br>
		Google has implemented its own version of MapReduce and uses it to efficiently process massive amounts of raw data at scale, such as crawled documents, web request logs, and much more.
